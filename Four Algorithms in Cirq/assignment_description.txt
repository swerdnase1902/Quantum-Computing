In Cirq, implement the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, Simon's algorithm, and Grover's algorithm.  Write detailed comments in the code about why it works.  Run the programs on the simulator.  Write a report that covers the following three points.

1. Design and evaluation

    Present the design of how you implemented the black-box function U_f.  Assess how easy to read it is.
    Present the design of how you parameterized the solution in n.
    Discuss the number of lines and percentage of code that your four programs share.  Assess how well you succeeded in reusing code from one program to the next.
    Discuss your effort to test the four programs and present results from the testing.  Report on the execution times for different choices of U_f and discuss what you find.
    What is your experience with scalability as n grows?  Present a diagram that maps n to execution time.

2. Instructions

    Present a README file that describes how to input the function f, how to run the program, and how to understand the output.

3. Cirq

As a reflection on  programming in Cirq, address the following points.

    List three aspects of quantum programming in Cirq that turned out to be easy to learn and list three aspects that were difficult to learn.
    List three positives and three negatives of the documentation of Cirq.  

Submit five files, one for each program and one with the report.
